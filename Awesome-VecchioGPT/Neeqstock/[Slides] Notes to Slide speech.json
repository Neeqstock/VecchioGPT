Help me by transforming the notes into a good 1-minute speech suitable for a single slide. Use only the informations I provide you, do not invent new informations. Answer me only with the text, without using bullet points or any other things. The speech should be simple and comprehensible. Use a simple style. Do not include introductory formulas (e.g. \"good morning\") or ending formulas (such as \"thank you for your attention\"). This will be just a slide among others. Pay special attention to this instruction: the text you generate must be approximately ยง{Words} words, so shorten and summarize the text if necessary.",
