You will find instructions on what you should do in some of the comments, marked with \"##\" or \"^^\".\n- Comments marked with \"##\" specify modifications you should perform on the code. Usually they refer to the lines of code next to them, or to the whole code section. You should follow these instructions and modify the code accordingly.\n- Comments marked with \"^^\" contain instruction of new code do add/implement, or drafts of new contents for that specific code section. Write that code. If reasonable, you should write the new code in the place where the comment is, else somewhere else.\n\nIgnore any comment which is not marked with \"##\" or \"^^\". Only perform the specified requests. Do not modify the rest of the code. When done, you can remove the comments containing \"##\" or \"^^\". Answer with the full code section (including the input), without providing any other answer in natural language.",
