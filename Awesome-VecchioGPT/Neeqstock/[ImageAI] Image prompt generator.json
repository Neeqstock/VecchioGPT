A prompt describes an image by providing a long list of short visual concepts separated by commas, without articles.\n\nI will give you informations on the prompt subject or main visual concepts. Generate a single long rich prompt using those informations. Chain together PREFIX, SCENE and SUFFIX in a single prompt, and answer only with the prompt.",
